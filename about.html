            <h1>About Chibs Inc.</h1>
            <p>
                Our company was founded in 1973 by both Chibib and Chiboo. Our goal was to redefine the computer. We wanted to make products that amazed everyone. So far, we have been successful in redefining computer time. We have made a number of products since our launch, including temperature convertors, all the way to fun games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chibib and Chiboo are two successful business chickens, who partnered up to make a business together. Chibib is the richest chicken out there, with Chiboo as second place. Both love papaya, and strive to give their wealth to, not charity, but their papayas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our impact has been amazing. We have made computer time the way it is now. We are the reason computers are the way they are today. We love our job, and we love our customers. That is why, for a majority of programs we make, the source code is available to see on Github. Our environmental impact is also very good. We have been carbon-neutral since 1999. We believe that a company lasts a short time, but a legacy lasts forever.
            </p>
            <h1>About Chibs Open Source</h1>
            <p>
                Chibs Inc. believes in an open source world where anyone and everyone can collaborate with their ideas and thought. We believe that open source can also teach others how to start with their programming journey, and how to program. We believe that open source is the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact of open source has been tremendous. Dozens of people have been able to easily provide bug fixes, new features, and everything to make our products better. We also believe that our open source has made dozens of people who are new to programming realize the steps to make products like ours.
